# SystemInfoReader
Get your basic PC specs using this program.

## WHY!?
I was bored so I managed to write this little app using my favourite language.

## Usage:
Download binaries in the **Releases** tab. Start the app, and the sysinfo.txt file will appear in the same directory as your app (Don't ask me why it works this way, thanks).

## Future features:
* Nice UI
* Flops calculator

## Installing deps
```npm i```,
Done!
